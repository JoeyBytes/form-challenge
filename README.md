# form-challenge
Go to https://joeybytes.github.io/form-challenge/ to access the vanilla JS implementation.

## Setup
To run locally, all you need is a browser to run the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I was using Visual Studio Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

## Limitations
* Use of CSS-Grid not compatible with IE
