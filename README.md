# form-challenge
Go to https://joeybytes.github.io/form-challenge/ to access the vanilla JS implementation.

## Setup
To run & test locally, all you need is a browser:
1. Download & go to the project folder on your filesystem
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

I was also using Visual Studio Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for local development.

## Limitations
* Use of CSS-Grid not compatible with IE
